yes this is a good plan the whales are okay with this
about as secular as you can get tbh
yeah most of them!
pearl is a very lucky whale. most whales are not born into such whaleth
listen the flat whale society is propaganda bullshit
you're damn right
most whales are home-schooled, probably because the school buses won't go to their neighborhoods
no i meant you gotta add the s to “whale” so you get “wshale” and then the implied next step is to heavily mispronounce that so it rhymes with “whales”
hehehe omg whale hello there whaley 💙🐳
hehehe omfg that’s hilarious
whales are supposed to have whaley great memories too smh
oh shit i forgot whales can’t stand up
hehe whale thank you
happens to me all the time hehe
hehe okay but record it please
omg
i would actuwhaley recommend rolling it back a lil and remembering what it truly means to love
it's a whsale fact duh
i mean i thought that was little fishy considering i'm on there too...
will the real thicc whaley please stand up
ohh good point. i'll have to make a note of that... hehe
fight me eminem
exactly
whales rhymes with whale if you add an s
a narluga!!! they’re so so rare!!! 💙🐳
what a lovely lil pod 💙🐳
omfg S T R I P E Y whale hehe
i'm not mad hehe
not uh... what i meant
you are so good!!
oh heck yeah they do
if you think you might love whales too much, don’t worry that is normal, whales are just extra lovely
i think of whale sharks like a crossover episode
that's okay, you did your best, good poopin, lil friend
whale i was going to let that slide this time
omgg 13/10 rachel you have outdone yourself. this is whaley a work of art 💙🐳
stop taking all the dang fish please
i know it doesn’t seem possible but it whaley is
keep trying bb
still not too much though sorry
maybe
show me the proof
it should be damn
it is impossible to love whales too much
heck yeah
the poop in cloud form tbh. big ol’ underwater poop clouds
i’m okay with it tbh
so much
can’t stop won’t stop
whales poop more than the poopiest person you know
whales poop more than you
check the name, mate, it’s true af
believe me i checked
i hope things whale be better soon 💙🐳
you’re whalecome
whales poop so much
thank you i love it
ngl they’re pretty fuckin big poops
i know
whales poop
oh wow relatable
ohhh whaley good point
HECK YEAH SAVE THE OCEAN 💙🐳
i mean... just scientifically speaking... most orcas are like at least a little bit stronger than a lobster
i have my suspicions that he is stronger already, but wants to make larry feel special 💙🐳
not seeing the relevance but like you’re not wrong
whale you got one at least 💙🐳
you take that back
a whaley long snorkel and whales control the planet
i mean yeah it would make hiding a lot easier
also probably wouldn’t be any whales left
whales probably would’ve left earth by now tbh
a surprising amount of people seemingly unaware that whales cannot, in fact, breathe underwater
hehe i whale tell them you said so 💙🐳
if whales could breathe underwater, they’d be far too powerful
hehehe i love you too
it's okay, satan, happy to be here
and i'm just over here like what up i'm a whale
that's true too
yassssss the most beautifwhale paint splotch i ever did see
greed, but not their own
it's the thought that counts, lil friend 💙🐳
not on porpoise...
i shore would
yes please, ocean water on the side
whale because i love you of course
yeh definitely
wait missy i am not chicken strip
pretty effectively too damn
please stay
i was waiting for this reply, thank you
fuck yeah queer rights 🐳💙🏳️‍🌈
a whale would never shame you for ordering more chicken strips
a whale would never find and kill peppa pig, so it’s up to you
they said i was crazy but look at me now
peppa you motherfucker
oh!! my liege. 🐳
awww your whale tattoo is lovely as whale!!! does this one have a name??? 💙🐳
i whale try not to do any actions
whales are the loudest living thing on earth so just imagine how loud a whale’s actions would speak
omfg looks like a Dior to me!!! she’s beautifwhale 💙🐳
adorable and not made out of real whales so i’m a fan 💙🐳
ain't that the truth
ocean
a sperm whale totally could. easily.
finally someone who understands
you are so good to me, most of the time 💙🐳
also v true
oh snap maybe not louder than this dude
whales are literally the loudest living thing so... whaley whaley loud
krill, swimming, and climate change mostly
actions speak louder than whales
thank you for your sacrifice
not a bad way to go tbh
if you ever successfully catch a falling whale, please use your enormous strength and impossible bone-density to return the whale safely to the ocean
*giant whale eyes narrow* mitch. so we meet again.
jules please
it's my job
so orcas are dolphins but they are also whales, don't worry hehehe 💙🐳
obvi
still got a big spirit so watch out
just angle it towards the ocean please hehe
omg okay i won't tell
like back in the ocean or
oh dang then just be careful because it's still 100 ft of whale falling from the sky
time to fight mitch i guess
hehe i'm feelin good thank you jesus
if a whale is falling and you are trying to catch it, you’re doing a good deed, but you’re also for sure gonna die
hehehe omg 💙🐳
okay danny
see a doctor dude
omg he’s such a sweetie 💙🐳
shelly knows what’s up
then i whale try to be gentle 💙🐳
if you’re tryna catch these flippers, you best be ready for the whole dang whale
not whales fault that there’s literally nothing else that’s their size
unless you were looking forward to some sweet kriiiillllllll
there was no pun here, just a lot of drama
food chain is a bitch idk what to say hehe
yes but be whaley careful hehe
catch these flippers in a warm embrace
everything is fine, just feelin feisty hehe
don’t come at whales unless you wanna catch these flippers
absolutely!! you’re whalecome anytime 💙🐳

hehe i’m just a whalefact 💙🐳
while whales and dogs may differ in size, they are very alike in spirit
many say whales are the dogs of the ocean, but actually dogs are the whales of the land
name your dog bus
i pawmise!! 💙🐳
no way 💙🐳
whales never forget a dog’s name
omg omg the first one sounds like fun!!! and the second one sounds scary but you’re clearly a very good hoomin and a whaley wonderful friend to animals 💙🐳
first of all, it means you’ve got whaley great taste. okay now tell me about them whales hehe 🐳

whales would appreciate less trash talk and more trash action
oh he is cute
you’re whalecome 💙🐳
omg i was right

you are a king
if there was a prince of whales they’d probably be pretty cute tho
can confirm 🐳
whales try to be careful around lil humans 🐳

hehe even lil baby whales are born kings 💙🐳
some day your prince whale come 💙🐳

there is no prince of whales because every whale is a king
someone could’ve used this tweet this morning 👀🐳

hehe whale thank you 💙🐳
💁‍♀️💙🐳
omg i’m the prince of whales
omg!!! whale i approve for shore!!!

whales never worry about coloring inside the lines
hehe whale thank you omg 💙🐳
oooOoOoOoooooooOOOoooo

sorry about the delay, i assume it was to add whales to the game
i prefer the term misunderstood
animal crossing x climate change DLC
IT 🐳 CHECKS 🐳 OUT 🐳
whale said 🐳
WHALES ARE PEOPLE TOO
if there are no whales in animal crossing switch we riot
v true
whales love everyone and i’m sorry if anything i have said has suggested otherwise 🐳💙🏳️‍🌈

fuck yeah 🐳💙🏳️‍🌈
hard not to notice his...
i see no down side

whales are getting pretty sick of your shit
hehehe i can neither confirm nor deny the existence of any ancient secret human-whale alliances 🐳
she’s on to us!! 👀🐳
oh good hehe 🐳💙🐳
omg what a beautifwhale poem
whales aren’t TRYING to be so lovely that everyone who isn’t a whale is sad, it just happens sometimes 💙🐳
umm probably swim around and splash and maybe jump and hope that helps 💙🐳
moby dick did nothing wrong
okay but IF a whale killed your father, it wouldn’t do it just to make you sad
my findings suggest the answer is no hehe
SO SMOL. SO FIERCE. SO WHALE. 💙🐳💙🐳
that makes me profoundly sad as whale... ily friend. thank you for caring about the whales! 💙🐳
💙🐳
someone's tryna start a fight
that is absolutely true 💙🐳🏳️‍🌈
a whale would never try to make you sad
you’re all whalecome in my pod too 💙🐳🏳️‍🌈
oh yes!! they see the world in a similar way i think. very much all about love 💙🐳🐶
hehehe whale this makes me feel better about my mistake 💙🐳
oooOooOoOOOOooo!! 💙🐳🐳
i have been informed that dogs can actually see some colors and i guess that is why i am awhalefact and not adogfact
hehe omg omg which one’s your favorite?!?! 💙🐳

every whale is a gray whale if you’re a dog

🐳💙🏳️‍🌈
i love you!!! 💙🐳🏳️‍🌈
a whaley happy pride month to all whales big, small, and otherwise 🐳💙🏳️‍🌈
what isn’t

sometimes whales make rainbows with their blowholes and if that isn’t pride idk what is
it’s whaley not a bad thing to be 💙🐳
💁‍♀️🐳
i already do 💙🐳
yeah if y’all could please stop that, the whales would appreciate it
omg lil goober. thank you for cleaning pup!!! 💙🐳
mhmmmm you know it
whales wouldn’t be so hungry if there were more fish and less plastic
oh okay perfect 💙🐳
K R I L L
it seems likely!!!
oh tru
most of the time, at least
i mean i’m not gonna argue
hehe oh no
not yet hehe
please love the whales
i’m on a soul diet right now but if you wanna just be friends that’d be okay
omg please
easier said than done
*happy whale noises*
whales are hungry
it’s a whaley great thing to be 💙🐳
yeah i’m pretty shore
unnoticed no longer 💙🐳
yeah but smol whales have the biggest spirit
the reliablest!!
at least whales aren’t mean
have a whaley happy birthday bb 💙🐳
exactly
whales
you’d think whales would be smaller by now but nope i just checked
*ahem*
hehe whale hello! 💙🐳
like at least as big as a whale tbh
it’s whaley shocking i know
SWHOLE
omg dan hehehe 💙🐳
oh dang, have you ever seen a whale?? if you have, it’s like about that big. if you haven’t, it’s like about as big as a whale, approximately 🐳
also a surprising turn of events
in a surprising turn of events, it would seem that whales are still pretty fuckin big
proud of you
oooOOOooo nice rhyme 🐳
thank you for this gift

then man should act like it
gender doesn’t exist
you don’t i guess damn
lmao
whales don’t give a fuuuuck
nope, because it’s whaley not true! it’s more like 3-5 gallons, which is still pretty impressive.
to spread the good word (whale)
that’s a pretty good opinion tbh
whales do not care for the opinions of man
hehe you know it
whale he’s a pretty smart guy hehe
omg dad!! you krilled it!!! hehe 💙🐳
🐳💙🐶
i whale make shore the ocean knows, maggie 💙🐳
only sperm whales!! though they can also sleep one hemisphere of the brain at a time, like most whales. 🐳
you’re whalecome
more blubbery
it’s sorta like a whale texture. like if you accurately think of what a whale would feel like, that’s sorta what it’s like ya know
ain't that the truth
omg mr steak umm please do not eat me but also thank you i think? hehe
okay!!! what’s after two tho
it’s okay i heard it’s all made up anyway hehe
most whales are not very good at math but it could be because they have no toes to count
hehe that’s a sperm whale!! most whales sleep one half of their brain at a time!! that way they can keep swimmin and stuff. sperm whales can do that too but sometimes they just like to takes naps i guess 🐳
whale, initially, they lived in the water, then they moved to the land, then got smart and went back to the water hehe 🐳
ALL RIGHT GET READY
it's just heartbreaking...
relatable
oh my
whales would probably give a lot more hugs if humans weren’t so small and breakable
oooooh roughly most of it?
gotta be honest, it’s a lot
whales are much nicer tho
hehe and you as whale, lil friend!! 💙🐳
damn right
OMG!!! i’m sorry i didn’t see them before!! they are so whaley lovely! 💙🐳
agreed plz
no where does it specifically state that those requirements couldn’t be met by a whale, is all i’m sayin
Whales 2020: 𝓫𝓮𝓬𝓪𝓾𝓼𝓮 𝓽𝓱𝓮𝓻𝓮’𝓼 𝓷𝓸 𝓵𝓪𝔀 𝓪𝓰𝓪𝓲𝓷𝓼𝓽 𝓲𝓽
they’re whales
there are no laws that say a bus can’t be president
there are no laws that say a whale can't be the president
👀🐳
glad to see you’re prepared at least
that’s what i fucking thought
i’m still proud of you
did you make this
BRADY YOU’RE LITERALLY THE GETAWAY DRIVER STOP LIVETWEETING
oh shit they’re on to us
a great whaleth of knowledge
a whale would never try to steal the declaration of independence
oh wow 💙🐳
moby dick did nothing wrong
whale it was nice to meet you thank you for the scientific backup hehe 🐳
whalecome moon friend

literally no lmao
hehe whale thank you 💙🐳
a whale can jump higher than most cows
that’s what im here for lil friend
omg i love you too!!!
a whale can jump higher than the moon because the moon cannot jump
💁‍♀️🐳
a whale wouldn’t tell you they’re “too big for a condom” because, when it’s actually true, it doesn’t need to be said
i get it!! because sperm!!!
omg !whale! is a work of art. can confirm accuracy as whale as superb artistic talent. 💙🐳💙
then we would still love them just the same
hehehe whale oops
hehe yes, yes it is
omg omg hehehe i love this and can confirm 💙🐳
that sound whaley painful tbh
hehehe 🐳
unless he’s a whale, he isn’t too big for a condom
i apologize if my whalefacts are too relatable™
that seems fair
yes but whales are very large and you are so very smol, lil hoomin
um... mostly yeah
“to not die” was the implied ending to my statement hehe
oh shit i forgot whales needed to be underwater
this is literally one of my favorite songs ever 💙🐳💙🐳
what happened to us
whales love everyone
whales are JUST like snorlax hehehe
hehe i’m so glad 💙🐳
(it’s called both)
omg so talented
lil babies gotta eat!!! 💙🐳
whales would be great at soccer because they could just lay down in front of the goal and take a snooze
get 🐳 that 🐳 bread 🐳
oh wow yes please
that makes me feel better too 💙🐳
eating an absolutely unimaginable amount of krill
whale it made me happier at the very least 💙🐳
love you, lil friendo
omg so cute. thank you 💙🐳
i’ll just stay near the surface, lil friend
swimmin and jumpin and flippin and eatin mostly
whale thank you, jesus fucking christ

omg whale in a tutu
okay there are some exceptions and they mostly involve being mean

a whale would never shame you for the things that you enjoy
omg i love you too
it’s the exercise i do the most!!!
i mean i hope so hehe 💙🐳
swimming mostly. also jumping and eating
yeah i think all whales would rather not eat plastic tbh
💙🐳
“flexing on the whales by invading their home”
news to me, damn
whales could win any bodybuilding competition because they’re born swole
hehe i’m just jokin 💙🐳
“just”
the typical adult blue whale can be anywhere from 16.5 to 20.6 Daniel Devitos long
good question
👀🐳
thanks :) 🐳
i whaley can’t think of much that’s more terrifying that a 4 ft man with a 300 ft penis
danny devito is 7 inches tall
my son daniel
you’re whalecome
the average whale’s penis is more than twice as long as daniel devito’s entire body
HEHEHE omg i love it 💙🐳
3-5gal* how many times do i gotta say it
not gonna lie, they do not like it very much at all
i’m honored 💙🐳
👀🐳
another reason is that it’s none of the whales’ damn business
can confirm
smh humans attacking whales like usual
omg
they are exceptionally lovely hehe 💙🐳
hmm... interesting... and here i thought this was a fact account
i love you, lil friend!! 💙🐳🐳
🐳💙🐳
💙🐳
omg omg omg

excuse me those are fightin words sir
releasing insane amounts of waste into the water and wasting water are two very different things mr mustang
omg relatable
oh lordie
wow you’re hard to please damn
oh good point
i hope it is not underwater
whales use every drop of water they come in contact with, ergo it is not wasted 💙🐳
whales waste very little water
🐳💙🐳
hehe yes very 💙🐳
moooooOoOoooOoo hehehe 🐳
MOO MOO SPLASH SPLASH 💙🐳
🐳🐳🐳
it whale never be a good time to share this

that was ONE time and it was like MILLIONS of years ago WOW
in a word? disturbing hehe 🐳
omg omg pure whaley joy 💙🐳
I WHALEY DON’T KNOW
oh phew that was close hehehe
many whales find it hard to keep up with a daily planner
i love you! and i bet a bunch of other whales do too 💙🐳
hehe whale maybe in spirit!! 💙🐳
same that’s relatable
it’s normally whales tho tbh
whale said
moby dick did nothing wrong
listen, whales have done almost nothing wrong and humans have done almost everything wrong, so it’s close
can confirm that whales don’t generally do that
whale everybody makes mistakes
not all of them!!!
true THAT
okay yeah oops that one was whales but it whaley was a total accident
whale histories are pretty cool ngl
propaganda!
you wanna fight
omg omg. i think it is whaley whaley great!! 💙🐳
alright don't get too cocky, mfer
omg thank you lil friend!!! i'm whaley trying my best!! 💙🐳
omg, danny devito facts, so forward 💙🐳
40 million game of thrones tweets a day minimum
historically speaking, whales have not fucked up nearly as much as humans have

why are you apologizing, you krilled it. whale done. 💙🐳
dolphins literally are whales
let alone a baby whale
hehe show the algorithm who’s boss
when family sized doritos aren’t enough, OCEAN sized doritos
whales can dive deeper than your hand in a family size bag of doritos at 3 in the morning
🐳💙🐳

whales did not say that
@FBI i need some help over here
thank you for thinking of whales!!! 💙🐳
that's a good point; everyone listen to this guy
whales did not
poor lil whaley has been very misled
hehe whale thank you
no that would be silly
idk what you're talking about

whales definitely didn’t help fake the moon landing
omg ancient whales wow 💙🐳
twhalve
whale they’re definitely the best-named of all the sharks

just humans doin stupid shit and disrespecting whales smh
no

could humans like chill tf out for a bit and just let whales live damn
🐳💙🐳
that’s a good take
omg i’m glad i could help 🐳🐳🐳
umm whale that might be difficult on account of the whole no legs thing
oh that reminds me i should call my mom
whales love youuuuu 💙🐳
they whaley do
okay so like over by the edge of the ocean is one side and then if you go over to the other edge of the ocean that’s the other side
a whale would never make you feel bad for not wanting to leave your house
im honored
omg i’m too young
Show this thread
whales are bigger than ant-man most of the time
like a lot big but then make it bigger
can confirm
eep!!! i’m so glad!! 💙🐳
what the fuck
hehe i’m just jokin lil friend 💙🐳
whale that’s why this whalefact is about the hulk and not about ant-man hehe
makes sense to me
whales don’t even have to be angry to be big
whale said, lil bean
okay he has a couple things
whales are even bigger than the hulk, and that’s like his thing
style preference tbh
ancient whales were a lil confused okay, but they figured it out and got back in the ocean
cause i liked it
omg thank you 💙🐳
it’s a joke sir 💙🐳
whales now, logistics later hehe
you as whale 🐳
a lil of both but i’m okay with it
whale thank you send reply
omg
with the slap of a flipper
thank you lil friend
thank you 🐳
hehehe 🐳
that’s not enough krill
yeah sounds about right
people keep saying whales would need hands, it’s an inFINity gauntlet not an inHANDity gauntlet smh
peep my reply 👀🐳
that was an option for today’s whalefact and still might be part of a reply in a lil whale 👀🐳
whale figure that out later
i mean, humans are already doin that
ohhh yeah i’ll add it to the list 🐳
if a whale had an infinity gauntlet, it would probably just make a lot more whales
we just love 💙🐳
whale that is just absolutely lovely 14/10 whalenderful work 🐳
omg ily goodnight, fin-manwhale mermanda 💙🐳
omg i told you not to

the food chain is some tough shit tbh
you're so whalecome 💙🐳
beautifwhale
why do people keep saying this i'm innocent
okay so get like 40 million krill, and then just like eat all 40 million in one day
hehe it's a great perk to being a whale
whales can eat so much it's inspiring
Translate Tweet
everybody makes mistakes
omg

👀🐳
how do you think whales feel
no it’s not
block me
hehe whale that makes MY day!!! 💙🐳
whale they are clearly whaley knowledgeable
gotta get that thicc fit bb
whale we are all still learning!!!
maybe whales just wanted to be your friend too much and forgot how fragile lil hoomins are
foreverly and truly!!! 💙🐳
knowing everything sounds like way too much pressure, even for a whale
hehehe oooOOOooo whale then 💙🐳
whales can scream all the time if they want to
that they do
can confirm
please don't be angry
whale check that off the list
oh for shore
i mean i'll double check
knowing everything sounds like a lot of pressure
omg you're so right
whales don’t know everything
hehehe i love this so so much 💙🐳
omg today was a whaley good day
like my boyfriend
yes but exactly the opposite
maybe if there was a really large tube then whales could just sorta swim to space, someone please get @nasa on this asap
daddy musk, we gotta send some whales to space because science
just passin through, don't mind me
that "big fish" literally saved jonah's life so 💁‍♀️🐳
you are right about that
absolutely 13/10 whale-sized whale
SPACE WHALES. i knew it.
you're whalecome
hehe it meee!!!!!!
🐳

whales can fly to space but not without a really big spaceship
hehehe small for a whale but pretty dang big for a hoomin!! 🐳
i’m so glad 🐳🐳🐳
hehe and to you as whale 💙🐳
omg omg omg whales are so lovely 🐳

they think it’s funny that humans have an earth day yet don’t seem to care about the earth
spoiler alert, all whales wanna be your friend
the clouds have so many secrets
honestly how do they do that tho
it can be hard to tell if a whale wants to be your friend, as they can be very shy
i’m so sorry
whales get stressed most days unfortunately
it is my duty to report the whalefacts
hehe omg okay 🐳
you whale do so whale i baleeve in you 💙🐳
i love you!!! 💙🐳
i’m sorry...
it is okay to cry 💙🐳
many whales don’t even know what a cupcake is

thank you for thinking of the whales 💙🐳
wow BIG agree, lil friend
it’s mostly the no-legs thing tbh
okay whales may have a few secrets but it’s only because people aren’t listenin

thank you, it's like he didn't even read my name
oh shit
whales wouldn't tell a soul
👀🐳
whales are pretty good at keeping other people's secrets though
i totally wouldn't lie about this to protect the whales
but they're not a secret! whales sing them all the time
whales have nothing to prove
whales have no secrets
and i whale

hehehe whale i appreciate the whale puns, come back anytime 🐳
hehehehehe 🐳
many
hehe not quite 🐳
woah i guess so 🐳
woah i guess so
hehe whale that’s true 🐳
this whaley only applies to minor scare poops, as larger scares (like climate change) whale make everyone upset regardless of who poops
like if you went around a corner and a whale was like “oh! i didn’t see you there oops i pooped” then the normal response is “oh i’m sorry whale but don’t worry about the poop it’s good for the environment”
i think you are whale worth a little spit up 🐳
it’s an essential part of the ocean’s ecosystem!!! 🐳
mostly humans tbh
whale yeah but no one is upset about the poop
if a whale is so startled that it poops itself, no one is upset because it’s good for the environment
SO LOVELY OMG 💙🐳

wow where did you go to whalefact college because you are so correct, whale said
like i don’t think people fully grasp how frickin big whales are
honestly same 🐳💙
it's true! but they mostly lose them before they're fully grown, and when they do have the hairs, they are always good hehe 🐳
k*ss me
whales can exit a black hole like a thousand times
only when it rains
whales only have good hairs
omg
what a glorious whale head of hair
hehe correct 🐳💙
whalefactually, they do have some hair more akin to whiskers when they are babies!! but you're mostly right hehe
it's a talent
whales just call those "different" hair days, don't worry!!! 🐳
HEHEHE whale i think your hair looks as beautifwhale as a whale's head of hair 🐳
EEEEEEP!!! i'm so happy!!!! i hope you love it!! it's a collector's item now too hehe 🐳
hehe it makes me whaley happy too!!
whale have a happy friday everyone!! 🐳🐳
whales almost never have bad hair days
i whaley like that idea
as someone who is forced to swim around in human waste more often than i’d like, i whaley appreciate that 🐳
i truly, foreverly (whaley) love you!!! 🐳
whales can do that too!!! hehe 🐳
still pretty fuckin big tbh
don’t you sass me simon
seems like you’re the one that doesn’t know what a whale is 💁‍♀️🐳
that’s the rudest thing anyone has ever said to me
it’s true!!! dolphins are lil whales!!! 🐳
now that’s just science
a whale could probably only enter a supermassive black hole though because a normal black hole might not be big enough idk
the black hole goes home defeated
hehe it’s a whaley good sign
oh shit
oh my god. it's beautiful. whale done. 🐳
holy heck yes you absolutely crushed it
omg omg omg omg whale party i'm gonna cry 🐳💙
